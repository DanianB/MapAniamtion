Name: MapAnimation

Description: The MapAnimation project was a project I had written as a part of an educational course.
the project includes a webpage with a map of Boston and a button in the top left corner. 
Pressing the button causes a blue marker to move across the screen.
the goal of the project is to show various bus stops between MIT and Harvard.

How to run: 
1. wait for the webpage to load the map
2. press the button in the top left of the webpage reading "Show stops between MIT and Harvard"
3. wait for the marker to move across the screen showing the various stops between MIT and Harvard University.

Roadmap of future improvements:
I hope to include a function that allows the marker to be paused in motion so that the various stops can be observed with ease.
I also wish to add a path or navigation for walking between stops.
